#Filters iCalendar-files and creates filters that _buteo-sync-plugin-webcal_ can use.
 
Currently, buteo-sync-plugin-webcal does not support filters. To filter iCalendar-files, the plugin (_libwebcal-client.so_) in _/usr/lib/buteo-plugins-qt5/oopp_ has to be replaced. The plugin that supports filters can be downloaded from https://github.com/hsjpekka/buteo-sync-plugin-webcal-filtered.

harbour-iCalendar-filters modifies _iCalendarFilters.json_ in _~/.config/null.hsjpekka/webcal-filters/_, but the buteo plugin reads its filters from _~/.config/webcal-client/_. Thus, to use it effectively, link these files:
´ln -s  ~/.config/null.hsjpekka/webcal-filters/iCalendarFilters.json ~/.config/webcal-client/´
